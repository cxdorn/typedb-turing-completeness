# Turing computation in TypeDB

While SQL can model Turing computation using recursive SQL functions and side effects, TypeQL's core syntax is much simpler and has neither functions nor side effects. Nonetheless, it's reasoning engine can be used to model Turing computation. This repositories contains a demonstration of this fact, by implementing SKI combinator calculus as a TypeDB database.
